## What is TypeScript?

The short version would be that typescript is Javascript but on some steroids called- more types.
However, the W3 schools would like to define it as 
```The superset of Javascript``` because it is javascripts with the ability of having more types. Read more here: ```https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_intro.php.```

## How do I use TypeScript?

It might interest you to know that there is a typescript compiler. Technically, it does trnaspile Typescript into Javascript. 
```Remember that its just Javascript but with additional types```
It is not surpsiing that it would need to be tanspiled back to javascript.
